## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Arsene Manzi

A passionate software engineer, cybersecurity enthusiast, and AI aficionado. Currently a computer science student with hands-on experience as a Web3 Analyst at Greenbrier and an AI Engineer/Team Lead at RadicalX, I love building innovative solutions that bridge technology, security, and digital experiences.

- **Tech Enthusiast:** Skilled in Python, Vue.js (React, Next.js), and full-stack development.
- **Cybersecurity & AI:** I enjoy exploring ways to secure systems and harness AI for engaging, interactive projects. I'm currently working on an AI-powered chat widgetâ€”a digital extension of myselfâ€”to enhance my portfolio.
- **Agile Practitioner:** I thrive in agile environments, continuously learning and collaborating to solve complex challenges.
- **Digital Collector:** I have a keen interest in preserving and showcasing unique digital content that merges art and technology.

I'm always eager to connect, collaborate, and contribute to cutting-edge projects. Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out!
